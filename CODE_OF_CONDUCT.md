"Do What The Fuck You Want, But Don't Be A Dick"

Do Whatever You Want

Use, modify, and distribute the code however you like.

No one owes you support, and you owe nothing to anyone.

Don’t Be A Dick

You can criticize code, but don’t harass people.

Disagreements are fine, but personal attacks are not.

No Bullshit

No bureaucracy, no committees, no virtue signaling.

If someone’s being a dick, call them out (or ignore them).

You’re On Your Own

If you get offended, that’s your problem.

If you can’t handle raw opinions, go somewhere else.

Final Rule

If this CoC annoys you, re-read the name of the WTFPL license (words 2, 3, and 4).
