# WTF Code of Conduct (WTFCoC)
*"Do What The Fuck You Want, But Don't Be A Dick"*

## The Short Version
1. **Do whatever you want** with the code
2. **Don't be a dick** to others
3. **No bureaucracy** - handle problems like adults
4. **You're on your own** - this isn't a safe space
5. **Final rule**: If this bothers you, re-read the WTFPL license name (words 2-4)

## The Slightly Longer Version

### 1. Freedom First
- Use, modify, distribute however you like
- No one owes you support or niceness

### 2. Don't Be A Dick (DBAD)
- Criticize code, not people
- Harassment = instant ban
- Spam = toilet reading material

### 3. No Bullshit Policy
- No virtue signaling
- No committees
- No tone policing
- Just code and STFU when needed

### 4. Survival of the Fittest
- Offended? Your problem
- Can't handle raw opinions? Go to a SAP project
- Drama? Take it outside

### 5. Enforcement
1. First offense: Public shaming
2. Second offense: Mockery
3. Third offense: `rm -rf` your contributions

## Final Notice
This CoC is WTFPL licensed - do WTF you want with it.
